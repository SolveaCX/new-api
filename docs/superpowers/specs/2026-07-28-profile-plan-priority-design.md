# Profile Plan Priority Design

## Goal

Make the active subscription plan the primary account summary on the profile page while keeping wallet balance visible as secondary information.

## Confirmed behavior

- When an active subscription exists, the profile header shows an independent, prominent plan summary.
- The summary shows the plan name, an active badge, remaining days, 5-hour and 7-day usage limits, monthly plan quota, remaining monthly quota, and usage progress bars.
- When no active subscription exists, the profile header renders no plan section and no empty-plan placeholder.
- Wallet balance moves into the identity area as a compact `Available balance` pill.
- Directly below the balance, the UI renders two complete guidance sentences as separate block rows:
  1. `Balance can be used to purchase plans directly.`
  2. `After plan quota is exhausted, balance is used automatically for API usage billing.`
- The guidance text never uses ellipsis or line clamping. It may wrap naturally on narrow viewports, but neither sentence is truncated.
- Total usage and API requests remain visible as compact secondary statistics.

## Data flow

`Profile` continues to load the user identity and wallet balance from `/api/user/self`. A profile-specific React Query hook loads `/api/subscription/self` through the existing `getSelfSubscriptionFull()` client and converts the optional response into a narrow `ProfileSubscriptionSummary`.

The summary adapter accepts a plan only when `current_subscription` exists and its subscription status is `active`. It reads the title from `current_subscription.plan`, the monthly quota from `monthly_bucket` with the top-level `quota` snapshot and current subscription amounts as defensive fallbacks, the short-window limits from `window_5h` and `window_7d`, and remaining days from `remaining_days`. The header receives only the derived summary instead of the full billing response.

Each usage window is normalized into total, used, remaining, unlimited, and percentage values. Invalid or negative values fall back to zero, percentages are clamped to 0–100, and a missing or zero-total 5-hour or 7-day window is treated as unlimited, matching the existing Wallet behavior.

## Component design

- `Profile` owns the subscription query and passes the optional summary to `ProfileHeader`.
- `ProfileHeader` remains responsible for presentation:
  - identity, role, user ID, username, email, and group;
  - secondary available-balance pill and its two guidance rows;
  - conditional active-plan summary;
  - total usage and API request statistics.
- The approved desktop composition is fixed:
  1. one top row with identity on the left and the compact balance plus two guidance rows on the right;
  2. one full-width horizontal plan band below the complete top row;
  3. two compact usage statistics below the optional plan band.
- The header card spans the full profile content width. Its left edge aligns exactly with the Settings column below, and its right edge aligns exactly with the Passkey/Two-factor column below.
- The plan must not render as a right-side vertical card or as a peer column beside identity.
- The 5-hour and 7-day limits render as two compact usage meters in one row above the monthly quota. Each meter shows used versus total, remaining quota, and a slim progress bar; unlimited windows display the translated `Unlimited` state.
- Monthly quota and remaining monthly quota share one horizontal row beneath the short-window meters. The monthly progress bar renders beneath them without nested metric cards.
- On narrow screens, identity, balance guidance, plan band, and statistics stack in that order.
- On narrow screens, the 5-hour and 7-day meters stack without horizontal overflow.
- When no active subscription exists, the plan band is omitted and statistics follow the top row directly.
- The plan progress percentage is clamped between 0 and 100. Unlimited quotas display the existing translated `Unlimited` label without an artificial finite percentage.
- The responsive layout is mobile-first. The guidance sentences remain normal block text without `truncate`, `line-clamp`, or fixed-height clipping.

## Error and loading behavior

- Profile identity loading remains controlled by the existing `useProfile()` state.
- Subscription loading does not block the profile header. Until subscription data is available, the optional plan section stays hidden.
- A failed, unsuccessful, or incomplete subscription response maps to no summary. The rest of the profile remains usable and no false `No plan` state is shown.
- This read-only enhancement does not display a subscription-error toast because the package section is optional and the requested fallback is to hide it.

## Internationalization and accessibility

- All user-visible labels and guidance use `t()`.
- Any new source keys are added with genuine translations to all eight locale files: English, Chinese, French, Russian, Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Portuguese.
- Existing semantic labels such as `Available balance`, `Current Plan`, `Active`, `Remaining days`, `Remaining`, and `Unlimited` are reused where suitable.
- The progress component exposes its value through the existing accessible progress primitive; decorative icons are hidden from assistive technology.

## Testing

- Unit-test the summary adapter for an active plan, missing plan, inactive plan, quota fallback, and invalid or failed response data.
- Render-test the header to confirm the plan name, quota values, remaining days, and progress are visible for an active plan.
- Render-test that the 5-hour and 7-day meters appear above the monthly quota, show normalized used/total and remaining values, and render unlimited windows correctly.
- Render-test that no plan section or placeholder appears without an active plan while identity, balance, total usage, and API requests remain visible.
- Render-test that the two complete balance guidance sentences are separate rows beneath the balance and have no truncation classes.
- Render-test that the header no longer has the compact 860px cap and uses the same full-width container edges as the Settings and Passkey columns below.
- Run the profile-focused tests, the complete Bun test suite, typecheck, lint, i18n synchronization/report checks, formatting checks, and `build:check`.
- Verify the final layout in a browser at desktop and mobile viewport widths.

## Scope and deployment

The change is limited to the authenticated console profile UI, its query/adapter, tests, and locale resources. It does not change subscription APIs, billing order, quota settlement, the public website, or router behavior.

`Router deploy: not required.` Only the `newapi-console` frontend build is affected.
