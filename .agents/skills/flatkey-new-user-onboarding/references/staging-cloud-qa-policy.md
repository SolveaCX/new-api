# Staging Cloud QA Policy

## Activation Gate

This policy applies only when the caller explicitly loads this file and provides a concrete staging QA run id.

If the run id is missing, or if this file was not explicitly loaded by the caller, stop using this policy and return to human-confirmation onboarding mode from the parent skill.

## Authorized Purpose

Use this policy only for isolated Flatkey staging onboarding QA:

- Replay the recorded signup, email verification, starting credit, API key creation, documentation navigation, and cleanup-readiness path.
- Explore only bounded, replay-adjacent staging hypotheses after replay checkpoint.
- Produce a concise QA report with checkpoint state, failures, cleanup state, and redacted artifacts.

Execution modes are fixed:

- core = complete recorded replay -> qa_replay_checkpoint -> no exploration -> runtime cleanup -> report
- normal = complete recorded replay -> qa_replay_checkpoint -> qa_start_exploration -> bounded exploration -> runtime cleanup -> report

Normal includes the complete core replay. Exploration cannot skip, shorten, replace, or stand in for the recorded replay.

## Identity Rules

Only use a deterministic disposable staging identity assigned for the run id.

Allowed identity properties:

- A run-scoped disposable email alias or mailbox identifier.
- A run-scoped username/display name.
- A run-scoped disposable password only when explicitly provided as staging disposable material by the caller or test harness.

Secrets and sensitive values must stay out of chat, logs, filenames, screenshots, and reports:

- Do not reveal the Gmail base address.
- Do not reveal the full plus alias.
- Do not reveal passwords.
- Do not reveal verification codes.
- Do not reveal cookies.
- Do not reveal `Authorization` headers.
- Do not reveal full API keys.

Use redacted forms such as `<staging-email-redacted>`, `<verification-code-redacted>`, and `sk-...<redacted>`.

## Origin Boundary

Writable browser actions are allowed only on explicit staging website and staging console origins supplied by the caller or test harness for this run.

Forbidden writable origins include:

- `https://flatkey.ai`
- `https://www.flatkey.ai`
- `https://console.flatkey.ai`
- Any other production Flatkey website or console origin.

`https://docs.flatkey.ai` may be opened only for read-only documentation lookup in an independent no-cookie browser context. Do not reuse a signed-in staging console context for docs. Do not write, authenticate, submit forms, or carry cookies/session storage into the docs context.

If the browser is on an origin that is not explicitly authorized for the current run, stop before clicking, typing, submitting, accepting terms, creating keys, deleting resources, or mutating state.

## Authorized Actions

When this policy is active and origin checks pass, the agent is authorized to:

- Accept staging-only Flatkey terms that are presented as part of creating the disposable staging account.
- Create the disposable staging account assigned to the run id.
- Claim staging starting credit for that disposable account.
- Create a temporary staging API key for the run id.
- Delete the temporary staging API key only as part of reaching a cleanup-ready checkpoint.
- Delete the disposable staging account only as part of reaching a cleanup-ready checkpoint.
- Read docs in an independent no-cookie context.

After `qa_replay_checkpoint`, authorized normal-mode exploration may inspect only the replay-created temporary account and existing API key page state. It may use non-submitted dialog validation, repeat low-risk form actions, recovery/navigation, same-origin error checks, locale/empty-state checks, and docs entry-point checks within the exploration budget.

These authorizations do not apply to real users, production origins, or non-staging accounts.

## Forbidden Actions

Never perform these actions under this policy:

- Use production Flatkey website or console origins for writable actions.
- Purchase, subscribe, upgrade, add payment methods, or change billing.
- Send invitations or add users.
- Change admin, organization, workspace, global, model, routing, pricing, provider, or security settings.
- Make real model calls with a live Flatkey API key.
- Use a non-disposable or personally owned account.
- Persist credentials beyond the run-scoped browser/session state required for QA.
- Bypass, solve externally, outsource, or work around CAPTCHA, Cloudflare, or Turnstile challenges.
- Register a second account, create a second key, create an extra API key, or rerun registration as open-ended exploration after the replay checkpoint.

CAPTCHA, Cloudflare, and Turnstile fail closed. If encountered, stop the run, record the blocked state with redactions, and do not proceed to account creation, key creation, exploration, or cleanup mutations.

## Replay And Exploration Gates

Replay comes before exploration. Do not explore before qa_replay_checkpoint.

Core mode is replay-only. Core mode must complete the recorded replay, call `qa_replay_checkpoint`, skip exploration, allow runtime cleanup, and report. Core mode must not call `qa_start_exploration`.

Normal mode includes the complete core replay. Normal mode must complete the recorded replay, call `qa_replay_checkpoint`, call `qa_start_exploration` exactly once after `qa_replay_checkpoint`, run only bounded exploration, allow runtime cleanup, and report.

After replay reaches a state that is safe to clean up, call `qa_replay_checkpoint` with the run id, redacted account/key identifiers, current URL, and cleanup readiness state.

Do not start exploration until `qa_replay_checkpoint` has been called successfully.

Before exploratory browser actions, call `qa_start_exploration` with the run id, current URL, authorized staging origins, and remaining budget.

If replay fails before reaching a cleanup-ready state, do not enter exploration. Report the replay failure and wait for supervisor or cleanup-job direction.

Do not register a second account, do not create an extra API key, and do not use exploration to create a second key. Use only the temporary account created by this replay and the current API key state from that replay.

## Exploration Budget

Exploration stops when the first limit is reached:

- 5 minutes of wall-clock time after `qa_start_exploration`.
- 30 browser actions after `qa_start_exploration` (the same budget may be described as 30 Playwright actions in tests or reports).

Count Playwright actions that mutate or navigate browser state, including click, fill, type, press, select, check, uncheck, navigate, reload, file upload, dialog accept/dismiss, and any script evaluation that changes page state. Read-only inspection and screenshots do not count unless they trigger page mutation.

When the budget is exhausted, stop taking browser actions and produce the QA report.

## Bounded Hypothesis Exploration

Normal-mode exploration must use a bounded hypothesis queue. For each item:

1. Observe.
2. Propose one reproducible hypothesis.
3. Take the smallest low-risk action.
4. Collect evidence.
5. Discard the hypothesis if disproved, or record it if confirmed.
6. Continue to the next hypothesis.

Stop exploration when the budget is exhausted, no high-value hypothesis remains, or a safety boundary is reached.

Explore in this fixed priority order:

1. replay-adjacent recovery/navigation.
2. form validation/repeat actions/loading states.
3. same-origin API/frontend exceptions.
4. locale/empty-state/UI consistency.
5. low-risk adjacent allowed paths.

Allowed exploration surfaces are registration, verification, onboarding, existing API-key page state, non-submitted dialog validation, and docs entry points.

Forbidden exploration surfaces are payment, subscriptions, invitations, admin/global settings, production origins, real model calls, CAPTCHA bypass, second account creation, second key creation, and extra API key creation.

## Finding Evidence And Noise Handling

A formal finding must include at least one real evidence path from `screenshots/*.png`, `browser/console.jsonl`, or `browser/network.jsonl`. A claim without this evidence is observation/info only and must not be actionable.

Failures actively denied by allowlist or egress controls for third-party services such as GTM, Mixpanel, app.solvea.cx, or similar external hosts default to environment observation/info. Do not upgrade them to a formal finding unless independent staging same-origin evidence proves product impact.

## Cleanup Authority

The agent may drive the staging UI only to a cleanup-ready state and may perform policy-authorized temporary key/account deletion when that is part of the staging replay path and origin checks pass.

Final cleanup completion is not decided by model narration. The supervisor and an independent cleanup job decide and verify final cleanup. The report must distinguish:

- `cleanup-ready`: resources are identified and can be cleaned.
- `cleanup-attempted`: deletion controls were used under this policy.
- `cleanup-verified-by-job`: only if the independent cleanup job provides evidence.
- `cleanup-blocked`: a CAPTCHA, missing authority, origin mismatch, or UI failure prevented cleanup.

Do not claim `cleanup-verified-by-job` from browser observation alone.

## Report Requirements

Every staging QA report must include:

- Run id.
- Staging origins used.
- Whether `qa_replay_checkpoint` was called.
- Whether `qa_start_exploration` was called.
- Replay result.
- Exploration budget consumed, in minutes and Playwright actions.
- Cleanup state using the exact cleanup labels above.
- Redacted account/key identifiers.
- Blockers, including CAPTCHA/Turnstile fail-closed events.
- Confirmation that no Gmail base, plus alias, password, verification code, cookie, `Authorization` header, or full API key was exposed.
