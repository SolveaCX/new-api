# GCP Operations Guide

Read this **before** touching anything under `deploy/gcp/`. Captures the parts of operating the GCP infrastructure that aren't obvious from the Terraform code, especially landmines that have already bitten this project.

This is the AI-facing operations playbook. Architecture inventory is in `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`; deploy/rollback procedures are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

---

## Project / environment

- **GCP project**: `vocai-gemini-prod` (project number `528088078482`)
- **Region**: `us-west1` (Oregon)
- **Terraform working directory**: `deploy/gcp/envs/prod/`
- **Terraform state**: GCS backend, bucket `vocai-gemini-prod-newapi-tfstate`, prefix `envs/prod` (versioning enabled — recoverable)
- **Sole approver / human-in-loop**: `slZhong` (manual deploy gate in GitHub Actions)

---

## Auth

Two separate token systems — they expire independently and you need both:

| Purpose | Command | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| Application Default Credentials (ADC) | `gcloud auth application-default login` | Terraform, REST API via `Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)` |
| User CLI session | `gcloud auth login` | `gcloud compute ...`, `gcloud run ...`, `gcloud sql ...` |

`gcloud auth application-default print-access-token` succeeding is **not** enough to prove `gcloud compute X` will work — those use the user-CLI token. If you see "Reauthentication failed. cannot prompt during non-interactive execution", the user-CLI token expired; ask the user to run `gcloud auth login`.

**Network gotcha**: the user's local network sometimes can't reach specific `*.googleapis.com` endpoints (notably `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`) — symptoms are `EOF` on `terraform plan/apply` or `Recv failure: Connection reset by peer` on curl. Test with:

```bash
curl -sS --connect-timeout 5 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v1/projects
```

`000` (timeout / RST) → network blocked, ask user to switch network/VPN before retrying. `401` → network works (auth header missing is fine for the probe).

---

## Resource ownership: who writes what

This is the single most important thing to know before running `terraform apply`. Several Cloud Run fields are written by **CI/CD at deploy time**, not Terraform. Terraform must `ignore_changes` on them or every plan will fight CI/CD and try to revert.

**Ignored on `google_cloud_run_v2_service`** (see `modules/cloud-run/main.tf`):

| Field | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `template[0].containers[0].image` | CI/CD | New image per deploy |
| `template[0].revision` | CI/CD | Pinned revision name per deploy |
| `client`, `client_version` | gcloud | Set by `gcloud run` writes |
| `scaling` (top-level block) | gcloud | Populated with zero values by `gcloud run services update` — harmless drift |
| `traffic` | CI/CD | Canary blue/green with revision-pinned tags; the LATEST block in TF is only for first bring-up |
| `template[0].containers[0].env` | gcp-deploy.yml + gcloud | PADDLE_*, GA_*, BATCH_UPDATER_RESET etc. exist only on the live service; the TF env blocks are bring-up defaults. Added to ignore_changes 2026-06-12 after a plain plan tried to strip the live payment config |
| `template[0].vpc_access` | gcloud | egress flipped to `ALL_TRAFFIC` out-of-band (fixed-IP egress); TF code still says `PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY` |

If a plan ever shows a diff on these fields, **do not apply**. Either the ignore list got broken, or CI/CD's state was lost — investigate, don't bulldoze.

**Env vars are out-of-band owned (in `ignore_changes` since 2026-06-12).** The env blocks in the TF module only seed a brand-new service; the live service's env is written by `gcp-deploy.yml` (PADDLE_*) and ad-hoc `gcloud run services update` (GA_*, secret refs, ...). Terraform neither strips nor updates env anymore. To change env on the live service (CI/CD's pinned revision names cause HTTP 409 on TF-driven updates anyway):

```bash
# Update env vars directly (gcloud auto-creates a new revision name)
gcloud run services update newapi \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --update-env-vars=KEY1=value1,KEY2=value2

# Then sync TF state without making changes
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

---

## Usage reconciliation token (`BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN`) — already set up, keep it on

The BlockRun usage reconciliation endpoints — `GET /usage/summary` and `GET /usage/transactions` (code: `controller/usage_reconciliation.go`, `router/usage_reconciliation.go`, auth in `middleware/usage_recon_auth.go`; design spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-blockrun-usage-reconciliation-design.md`) — authenticate with a single static Bearer token read from env `BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN`. Same value goes to the external reconciliation consumer.

**State (as of 2026-06-08):**

- Secret Manager secret `newapi-blockrun-usage-summary-token` exists (Terraform-owned: `google_secret_manager_secret.blockrun_usage_summary_token` in `envs/prod/main.tf`), value set (version 1), runtime SA `newapi-runtime@vocai-gemini-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` granted `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`.
- The env was **pre-injected on the live service via gcloud** (`gcloud run services update newapi --update-secrets=BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN=newapi-blockrun-usage-summary-token:latest --no-traffic`), creating revision `newapi-00051-v4v` at **0% traffic** (serving revision and the `canary` tag were left untouched). So `spec.template` already carries the secret env, and every later CI image deploy inherits it — `gcp-deploy.yml` uses `--update-env-vars` (a delta) + `--image`, which preserves existing env/secrets rather than replacing them.
- `enable_usage_recon_token = true` in `envs/prod/terraform.tfvars` gates the `dynamic "env"` block in `modules/cloud-run/main.tf`.

**Don't break it:**

- **Keep `enable_usage_recon_token = true`.** It keeps desired-state honest and seeds fresh bring-ups. (Env is in `ignore_changes` since 2026-06-12, so `terraform apply` no longer strips live env either way — but don't rely on that to paper over a wrong flag.)
- The env was set out-of-band via gcloud, so TF state can lag reality. The committed flag keeps desired-state aligned, so a refreshing `terraform plan` shows no env diff; run `terraform apply -refresh-only` to sync state exactly.
- When writing the secret value, use `printf '%s'`, not `echo` (no trailing newline in the token).

**Rotate the token** (single shared secret — the reconciliation consumer must change in lockstep):

```bash
printf '%s' '<new-token>' | gcloud secrets versions add newapi-blockrun-usage-summary-token \
  --project=vocai-gemini-prod --data-file=-
gcloud run services update newapi --region=us-west1 --project=vocai-gemini-prod \
  --update-secrets=BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN=newapi-blockrun-usage-summary-token:latest
# then shift traffic to the new revision — see the revision-pinned traffic section above
```

First-time setup runbook: `DEPLOYMENT.md` → "用量对账 token（`BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN`）".

## Terraform authority and IAM/WIF bootstrap

`gcp-infra.yml` is intentionally static-only. It has `contents: read`, no
`id-token`, no `google-github-actions/auth`, no production backend access, no
plan, and no apply. Its init is exactly `terraform init -backend=false
-input=false`; it then runs validate and the supplier deployment security
contracts. It cannot report live drift or authorize a production change.

Production Terraform uses local, reviewed Owner ADC. Always run a refreshing
plan and inspect it before apply:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
terraform -chdir=deploy/gcp/envs/prod init
terraform -chdir=deploy/gcp/envs/prod plan -input=false -out=newapi.plan
terraform -chdir=deploy/gcp/envs/prod show newapi.plan
terraform -chdir=deploy/gcp/envs/prod apply newapi.plan
```

The initial IAM/WIF split has a strict bootstrap order because a new WIF
identity cannot create itself:

1. Freeze deploy, rollback, and Supplier promotion workflows; harden the
   external GitHub branch/environment controls listed below.
2. Review a refreshing Terraform plan from an operator environment with Owner
   ADC. It must add the fixed service accounts, custom roles, exact
   service/repository/runtime-SA bindings, and all WIF pools/providers while
   removing the old project-wide deployer grants and repository-wide WIF
   impersonation binding.
3. Apply that saved plan locally. During the short cutover window, old
   workflows must fail closed because `newapi-ci-deployer` is already
   build-only while they may still reference it for deployment.
4. Verify the fixed service-account emails/providers and resource IAM, audit
   the state-bucket IAM separately, and prove the generic builder has no Run,
   Job, Scheduler, runtime-SA `actAs`, or Terraform-state access.
5. Merge/enable the workflows that name the fixed identities, exercise the
   expected positive lane and cross-lane negative authorization checks, then
   end the deployment freeze.

The historical `newapi-ci-deployer` is an Artifact Registry
repository-scoped writer only. It has no Cloud Run, Job, Scheduler, or `actAs`.
Production Console, Router, website and staging deploy each use fixed deploy
identities with project-level read-only Run observation, exact service mutation, repository
reader, and exact runtime-SA `actAs`. Console/Router rollback identities have
only project-level read-only observation plus exact service mutation; they deliberately have
no Artifact Registry permission and no `actAs`. Do not add a generic
`GCP_DEPLOYER_SA` escape hatch.

Supplier promotion uses `newapi-supplier-promoter`. Its mutation role is
exactly `run.jobs.get/update/run`; a separate project-level read-only observer permits the
required service/revision/execution/operation/log reads. It has reader access
only on the fixed Artifact Registry repository and `actAs` only on
`newapi-supplier-batch-runner`. It has zero `cloudscheduler.*` permissions.

External GitHub controls are manual fail-closed prerequisites. Current evidence
shows that `production`, `production-console`, and `production-router` have
reviewers but no deployment branch policy and `prevent_self_review=false`; the
`staging` branch is unprotected; `production-infra` does not exist and there is
no CI infra identity; `SUPPLIER_DEPLOY_ROOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
`SUPPLIER_DEPLOY_ROOT_USER_ID` are missing. This repository change does not
claim to have modified those settings. Configure and independently verify the
branch/environment protections and Root inputs before using the affected lane;
otherwise the workflow must fail closed. Never copy production Root inputs to
staging.

---

## Cloud Run traffic is revision-pinned — gcloud-only scaling tweaks don't auto-receive traffic

When CI/CD deploys a new image, the workflow pins traffic to that specific revision name (the LATEST block in Terraform is only for first bring-up). After such a deploy, `spec.traffic[*].latestRevision == false` and traffic = 100% on the explicit revision name.

**Consequence**: if you then run `gcloud run services update newapi --min-instances=X --concurrency=Y` to tweak scaling, gcloud creates a **brand-new revision** (with auto-generated name like `newapi-00021-zxs`) carrying the new scaling. But **traffic stays on the previously-pinned revision**, which keeps the old scaling values. You'll see `spec.template.containerConcurrency = 50` in `services describe` (that's the next revision's template), but in reality 100% of traffic is still served by the old revision at conc=80.

To make the new scaling take effect immediately:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic newapi \
  --region=us-west1 \
  --project=vocai-gemini-prod \
  --to-revisions=newapi-00021-zxs=100
```

Verify with:

```bash
gcloud run services describe newapi --region=us-west1 --project=vocai-gemini-prod \
  --format='value(status.traffic)'
# Want: status.traffic[0].revisionName=newapi-00021-zxs, percent=100
```

After traffic flips, the next CI/CD app deploy still works normally — it creates yet another revision (with commit-hash suffix), inherits the *current* `spec.template` (so new scaling carries over), and re-pins traffic to itself.

To roll back to the prior revision quickly:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic newapi --region=us-west1 --project=vocai-gemini-prod \
  --to-revisions=<previous-revision-name>=100
```

> **Supplier accounting control-plane warning:** direct `gcloud run services update-traffic` is a separately authorized break-glass path once supplier accounting manifests/capabilities exist. Ordinary production/staging application deploys never inspect or mutate `newapi-supplier-batch`; ordinary Console/Router rollback must use `GCP Rollback`, which reads authenticated `admin_command_ledger_state` and verifies canonical manifest, numeric capabilities, OCI digest, and immutable binding before shifting traffic. Runner image ownership belongs only to `GCP Promote Supplier Runner` after finalization.

The same rule applies to the split production services:

| Service | Role | Normal traffic owner |
|---|---|---|
| `newapi-console` | console/admin/API, `NODE_TYPE=master` | `console.flatkey.ai` |
| `newapi-router` | model relay/API, `NODE_TYPE=slave` | `router.flatkey.ai` |
| `newapi-web` | public website | `flatkey.ai`, `www.flatkey.ai` |
| `newapi-console` | fallback for unmatched hosts | URL map default backend |

When rolling back or shifting traffic, target the specific service that serves the failing host. The legacy `newapi` service is currently disabled (`enable_legacy_runtime=false`), so a `newapi` rollback is not available unless the legacy runtime is intentionally restored first.

---

## Production runtime split

Current production routing is host-based at the GCP LB:

| Host | Backend service | Cloud Run service | Runtime role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flatkey.ai`, `www.flatkey.ai` | `newapi-web-backend` | `newapi-web` | Next.js website |
| `console.flatkey.ai` | `newapi-console-backend` | `newapi-console` | Go app, `NODE_TYPE=master`, `APP_ROLE=console` |
| `router.flatkey.ai` | `newapi-router-backend` | `newapi-router` | Go app, `NODE_TYPE=slave`, `APP_ROLE=router` |
| default | `newapi-console-backend` | `newapi-console` | fallback for unmatched hosts |

Verify the live URL map before and after any host-split change:

```bash
gcloud compute url-maps describe newapi-urlmap \
  --project=vocai-gemini-prod --global \
  --format='yaml(hostRules,pathMatchers,defaultService)'
```

Rollback levers:

- Bad console revision: `gcloud run services update-traffic newapi-console ... --to-revisions=<old>=100`
- Bad router revision: `gcloud run services update-traffic newapi-router ... --to-revisions=<old>=100`
- Bad website revision: `gcloud run services update-traffic newapi-web ... --to-revisions=<old>=100`
- Bad console host split: set `console_domains = []`, plan, review URL map diff, apply
- Bad router host split: set `router_domains = []`, plan, review URL map diff, apply
- Bad website host split: set `website_domains = []`, plan, review URL map diff, apply

Host-rule rollback sends new requests to the URL map default backend (`newapi-console-backend`). It does not stop in-flight requests on the previous Cloud Run revision, but it can change application behavior if the fallback service has different image/env. Check logs before choosing host-rule rollback over revision rollback.

## Supplier accounting exact backlog monitoring

The existing `newapi-router` Managed Prometheus sidecar scrapes `/metrics` every 30 seconds. Supplier backlog alerting uses only DB-derived current gauges from that surface:

- `newapi_supplier_accounting_never_published_days`: current count of eligible Shanghai dates with `published_fence_token = 0`;
- `newapi_supplier_accounting_oldest_never_published_age_seconds`: current age of the oldest such date;
- `newapi_supplier_accounting_prior_day_unpublished_after_0800`: `1` only when the prior Shanghai day is still unpublished at or after 08:00;
- `newapi_supplier_accounting_backlog_observer_up`: `1` after a successful snapshot, `0` when the snapshot fails;
- `newapi_supplier_accounting_backlog_observed_at_seconds`: database observation timestamp used to corroborate freshness.

Terraform creates these alert policies only while `supplier_batch_job_enabled=true` and notification email configuration is non-empty. Phase one with the flag false creates no supplier policy and no absence alert. This monitoring adds no Job, Scheduler, service account, IAM edge, secret, log metric, database table/index, or LB/DNS resource.

All alert filters use `resource.type="prometheus_target"` plus `service=newapi-router` (the configured `router_service_name`). They group only by service and apply `REDUCE_MAX` across instance and revision. Never sum these gauges: every Router observes the same shared DB state, so summing would multiply the backlog by instance count. Backlog, age, and 08:00 thresholds must remain true for 60 seconds, covering at least two 30-second scrapes. Observer health pages when the service-wide max stays below one for 120 seconds or the metric is absent for 120 seconds.

Each Router sidecar scrapes independently, so the observer's database read amplification scales with live instance count. Before enabling in production, G006 must capture production-equivalent maximum-scale scrape volume, snapshot latency, connection/CPU/lock impact, and series cardinality. G006 also owns approved live/staging fire-and-resolve evidence for all three backlog/SLO thresholds plus observer-down and metric-absence conditions, including the `observed_at_seconds` timeline. Terraform syntax or plan output alone is not that evidence.

## HTTPS LB cert rotation has a downtime window

The managed SSL cert is recreated whenever `lb_domains` changes (via `random_id.cert_suffix` keepers). With `create_before_destroy`, Terraform creates the new cert and points the HTTPS proxy at it **before** destroying the old one. That sounds safe but isn't:

- The new cert is in `PROVISIONING` immediately after creation
- The HTTPS proxy now references only the new cert (old one detached)
- Until Google verifies all listed domains' DNS and signs the cert (10–30 min), the LB has no usable cert
- **All HTTPS traffic to all domains in `lb_domains` fails during that window** (TLS handshake errors like `SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL`)

Always warn the user before applying a `lb_domains` change. Schedule it during low-traffic windows.

**Check cert status without gcloud CLI** (works with just ADC):

```bash
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vocai-gemini-prod/global/sslCertificates?filter=name+eq+.*newapi-cert.*" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); [print(c['name'],'|',c['managed']['status'],'|',c['managed'].get('domainStatus',{})) for c in d.get('items',[])]"
```

`domainStatus` showing all `ACTIVE` but `status: PROVISIONING` means cert is about to flip — typically a few more minutes. Outright `FAILED_NOT_VISIBLE` means DNS isn't pointing at the LB IP yet — fix DNS, then bump the `cert_rotation` Terraform variable to force-recreate the cert.

---

## Cloudflare DNS mode

Current production uses a deliberate mixed Cloudflare mode:

| Host | Mode | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `flatkey.ai`, `www.flatkey.ai` | Proxied | Public website, covered by Cloudflare Universal SSL |
| `console.flatkey.ai` | Proxied | Console is intentionally kept out of GCP `lb_domains` to avoid managed-cert rotation |
| `router.flatkey.ai` | DNS only | Covered by GCP managed cert; avoids proxy behavior on long-lived model calls |
| `new-api.app.flatkey.ai`, `new-api.api.flatkey.ai` | DNS only | Depth-3 names are not covered by Cloudflare Universal SSL |
| `one.flatkey.ai` | DNS only | Legacy/compatibility entry |

Cloudflare's "origin IP partially exposed" warning is expected because the same GCP LB IP has both Proxied and DNS-only records.

Do not flip DNS modes casually:

- Switching depth-3 names to Proxied fails unless Cloudflare Total TLS / ACM is enabled.
- Switching `console.flatkey.ai` to DNS-only would require adding it to GCP `lb_domains`, which triggers managed cert rotation and a possible HTTPS downtime window.
- Switching `router.flatkey.ai` to Proxied is technically possible at depth 2, but should be tested for streaming/model-call behavior first.

To use Proxied for depth-3 names would require Total TLS ($10/mo) — previously declined per cost.

---

## CI/CD constraints

- Build jobs use the `github-actions` WIF pool and build-only `newapi-ci-deployer`; deploy, rollback, website, staging, and supplier promotion use separate workflow/ref/event/subject-pinned pools and fixed service accounts. No lane accepts a generic deployer SA.
- Push to `main` triggers `build` automatically.
- `GCP Promote Supplier Runner` operates only on the fixed Terraform-owned `newapi-supplier-batch` Job. It verifies the Job association before and after the digest update and then executes it once; it never calls Scheduler and leaves `newapi-supplier-batch-daily` paused.
- The presence of reviewers is insufficient by itself: configure deployment branch policies and prevent self-review for production environments, protect `staging`, and provision the production Root secret/variable before use. Current observed gaps are listed in “Terraform authority and IAM/WIF bootstrap”; this document does not claim they were fixed.
- Don't bypass an approval gate or missing prerequisite. Don't merge to main without an approved PR (the auto-mode classifier will block direct merges).

---

## Common destructive actions — confirm first

- Any change to `lb_domains` (causes HTTPS downtime window — see above)
- `terraform destroy` on any module (obviously)
- Bumping `cert_rotation` while a cert is currently ACTIVE (causes new downtime window unnecessarily)
- Removing or changing `router_domains`, `console_domains`, or `website_domains` (changes live host routing)
- Changing Cloudflare proxy mode for `console.flatkey.ai` or `router.flatkey.ai`
- Editing `ServerAddress` admin setting (breaks OAuth callbacks, video proxy URLs, email reset links until rolled to all instances)
- Setting `enable_usage_recon_token = false` or removing the `BLOCKRUN_USAGE_SUMMARY_TOKEN` secret env (breaks the `/usage` reconciliation endpoints → 503; see the section above)

---

## Whitelabel channels (kuaizi etc.)

Some video channels run through the whitelabel pipeline — customer-facing responses must hide upstream provider identity. The registry is in `relay/channel/task/taskcommon/helpers.go::whitelabelChannels`. When adding a new whitelabel channel:

1. Add the channel type constant to that map
2. Add a case in `controller/video_proxy.go::VideoProxy` to resolve the real upstream URL from `task.Data` (see kuaizi case for the pattern)
3. Optionally provide an `ExtractUpstream...VideoURL` helper inside the channel adaptor package

The `ScrubBrandedText` helper has a keyword list — extend `brandKeywords` if the new provider's name leaks through error strings.

---

## When in doubt

1. **Plan before apply, always.** Save with `terraform plan -out=newapi.plan` and inspect.
2. **Targeted applies don't help here** — `cloud_lb` references `cloud_run` so `-target=module.cloud_lb` will still pull cloud_run changes. Fix the lifecycle config instead.
3. **State is recoverable** — GCS versioning is on. If state corrupts, list versions: `gsutil ls -a gs://vocai-gemini-prod-newapi-tfstate/envs/prod/default.tfstate`.
